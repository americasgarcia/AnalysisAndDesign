In these projects, I worked on analyzing run-time and memory for different data structures and built a course planner program that could load, sort, and display classes with their pre-requisites. The main challenge was figuring out how to organize the data so the program ran efficiently and was easy for users to interact with. 
I approached it by breaking the problem into smaller steps, first loading the data then storing it in a hash map for fast lookups, and finally sorting it to display in order. This showed me why data structures matter so much, picking the right one makes all the difference in speed and performance. Some roadblocks came up with file input and making sure messy or duplicate data didn't cause errors. I got through that by adding checks, trimming inputs and handling edge cases. Once I worked through those, the program felt a lot smoother. 
What I took from this course is that software design isn't just about getting something to work, it's about making it clean, readable, and adaptable for the future. I've become more intentional about writing code that's organized and easy to maintain, and that's something I'll carry into every project going forward.
